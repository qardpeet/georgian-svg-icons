# Georgian svg icons üéà
I created this repo just to keep track of my **personal** Icon development. If you find any use for my icons, feel free to. Don't forget to star the repo if you do üçì.

### Make them your own
While you can use the icons without modifying them, like on a website, you can also give the icons some character. Have fun with the icons, make them your own!
